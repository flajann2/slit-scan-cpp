* Slit Scan, C++ version
  For reasons, we have decided to implement Slit Scan
  in C++, and give it a nice GUI to boot.

  The GUI situation is wanting in Haskell, alas. I
  began this same effort as a CLI app, but then many
  would not have an easy go using it.

  So this will use GTK4 and gtkmm and all the lastest
  features of C++23.
