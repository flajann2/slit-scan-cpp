* Playground
  The examples in the playground here are not really
  example usage of SlitScan, but are
  my explorations of the GUI, of the
  SS Algorithm, of GTK4, video streaming, etc.

  As such, all of these test programs were POC
  for what makes up SlitScan. They are valuable 
  for demonstrating how to perform various
  operations without having the full application
  up and going yet.
